    description: >
      We will manually generate some fake data based on how many hours students study (hours of homework)
      and their exam scores, as we will be wanting to try and find the link!
    steps:
      - markdown: >
          Import `numpy` and `matplotlib`, which are used for linear algebra and graph plotting respectivly
        code: |
          import numpy as np
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

      - markdown: >
          Override the theme that `matplotlib` uses, and use one that is similar to the graphs produces in R.
        code: |
          import numpy as np
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

          plt.style.use("ggplot")

      - markdown: >
          Create two arrays of the same length, `hours_studied` and `exam_scores`.
        code: |
          import numpy as np
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

          plt.style.use("ggplot")

          hours_studied = [1,  1,  1,  1.5, 1.5, 2,  2,  2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3,  3,  3,  3,  3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4,  4,  4]
          exam_scores =   [50, 45, 52, 56,  58,  59, 64, 63,  69,  57,  68, 78, 74, 72, 72,  75,  69,  84, 82, 80]

      - markdown: >
          Create a scatter graph from the two arrays we just created.
          We give it a `label` property too so that when we create a legend it automatically gets assigned a name.
        code: |
          import numpy as np
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

          plt.style.use("ggplot")

          hours_studied = [1,  1,  1,  1.5, 1.5, 2,  2,  2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3,  3,  3,  3,  3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4,  4,  4]
          exam_scores =   [50, 45, 52, 56,  58,  59, 64, 63,  69,  57,  68, 78, 74, 72, 72,  75,  69,  84, 82, 80]

          plt.scatter(hours_studied, exam_scores, label="data", marker="x", color="blue")

      - markdown: >
          We create a legend, and this legend will automatically find a suitable place in the
          graph that tries to not overlay existing data points..
        code: |
          import numpy as np
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

          plt.style.use("ggplot")

          hours_studied = [1,  1,  1,  1.5, 1.5, 2,  2,  2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3,  3,  3,  3,  3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4,  4,  4]
          exam_scores =   [50, 45, 52, 56,  58,  59, 64, 63,  69,  57,  68, 78, 74, 72, 72,  75,  69,  84, 82, 80]

          plt.scatter(hours_studied, exam_scores, label="data", marker="x", color="blue")
          plt.legend(loc="best")

      - markdown: >
          We specify our $x$ label and $y$ labels for better readability.
        code: |
          import numpy as np
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

          plt.style.use("ggplot")

          hours_studied = [1,  1,  1,  1.5, 1.5, 2,  2,  2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3,  3,  3,  3,  3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4,  4,  4]
          exam_scores =   [50, 45, 52, 56,  58,  59, 64, 63,  69,  57,  68, 78, 74, 72, 72,  75,  69,  84, 82, 80]

          plt.scatter(hours_studied, exam_scores, label="data", marker="x", color="blue")
          plt.legend(loc="best")
          plt.xlabel("Hours Of Homework")
          plt.ylabel("Exam Score")

      - markdown: >
          Finally with `matplotlib`, we need to render the graph
        code: |
          import numpy as np
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

          plt.style.use("ggplot")

          hours_studied = [1,  1,  1,  1.5, 1.5, 2,  2,  2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3,  3,  3,  3,  3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4,  4,  4]
          exam_scores =   [50, 45, 52, 56,  58,  59, 64, 63,  69,  57,  68, 78, 74, 72, 72,  75,  69,  84, 82, 80]

          plt.scatter(hours_studied, exam_scores, label="data", marker="x", color="blue")
          plt.legend(loc="best")
          plt.xlabel("Hours Of Homework")
          plt.ylabel("Exam Score")
          plt.show()
